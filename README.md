# Calculator

## Brief

Programme a calculator using Javascript.
It must have an advanced function that will calculate power and square root.

The basic function should use the operators + - / * to make calculations.

## Challenges

Remembering the syntax of javascript after a short Codecademy course was a challenge. Getting the Square root method to work, i was trying to parseInt the data unnecessarily.

Using Codcademy is very different to actually using it to make a programme.

## What went well?

Once I realised how to store the variable using the prompt the basic calculator was not to hard to finish.
